1.	Write Python code for extracting Title and href attributes from a HTML document?

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')
title = soup.title.string
print("Title:", title)
hrefs = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]
print("Links:", hrefs)


2.	Write a Python function that uses CSS selectors to extract all links from a given webpage.

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

def extract_links(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    links = [a['href'] for a in soup.select('a[href]')]
    return links

url = 'https://example.com'
print("Links:", extract_links(url))
